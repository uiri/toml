QUICK GUIDE
-----------

``pip install toml``

toml.loads --- takes a string to be parsed as toml and returns the corresponding dictionary

toml.dumps --- takes a dictionary and returns a string which is the contents of the corresponding toml file.

There are other functions which I use to dump and load various fragments of toml but dumps and loads will cover most usage.
