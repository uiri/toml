Releasing
*********

New versions of the TOML library are released on PyPI and installable via pip.

A new release is marked via a git tag.

Version numbering loosely follows semantic versioning.

1.0.0 will be the first version to support TOML 1.0.0. TOML still has yet to
hit TOML 1.0.0 so its release is postponed indefinitely.

The version number is recorded in the source code (``toml.py``) itself as the
``__version__`` variable.

The LICENSE Copyright notice should be up to date with a year-author pair for
each significant contributor.
